# Logic-Circuitry
A simulation of electrical circuits on the gate logic level.

I still like this project a lot but I haven't worked on it for a long time. I didn't get very far with it overall so I'm considering switching to C++ and trying this one again in the future as I am really enjoying graphics with C++ recently.
